  * @version 09/19/2017
  *
  * Instructions:
  * Write a program that places 8 queens on an 8x8 board where none
  * of the queens are in conflict with each other. You are to
  * implement the Hill-Climbing algorithm with random restarts...
  *
  * Steps:
  * 1 - Place each queen randomly in its column. ------------------------------------ done
  * 2 - Check for goal state right away (no queens in conflict) --------------------- done
  * 3 - Evaluate all possible neighbor states by moving each queen ------------------ done
  *     up and down it's column. Keep track of each heuristic value.
  * 4 - If a lower heuristic was NOT found, restarts -------------------------------- done
  * 5 - Else, update current state to the newly found lower heuristic state --------- done
  *
  * Heuristic: How far away you are from the goal. In this case, it is
  *            # of conflicts.
